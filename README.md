Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

WHY IT IS USED?
Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and more—making it easier to manage applications.

HOW DOES IT WORKS?

Kubernetes networking works by creating pods and services. A pod is a group of one or more containers that are deployed together and share a network namespace and IP address. Containers within a pod can communicate with each other using a localhost. Services are used to expose one or more pods to the outside world.
